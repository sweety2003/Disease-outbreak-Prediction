# Disease-outbreak-Prediction
# **Multi-Disease Prediction System**  

This project is a **machine learning-based web app** for predicting diseases like **diabetes and Parkinsonâ€™s** using user-inputted health data. It is built with **Python, Streamlit, and machine learning models** like Random Forest and SVM. The system processes medical data, selects key features, and provides real-time predictions. **Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow** are used for data analysis and model training. To run the app, install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` and launch it with `streamlit run app.py`.
